  abstract     = "Macroecology is an approach to science that emphasizes the
                  description and explanation of patterns and processes at
                  large spatial and temporal scales. Some scientists liken it
                  to seeing the forest through the trees, giving the proverbial
                  phrase an ecological twist. The term itself was first
                  introduced to the modern literature by James H. Brown and
                  Brian A. Maurer in a 1989 paper, and it is Brown's classic
                  1995 study, Macroecology, that is credited with inspiring the
                  broad-scale subfield of ecology. But as with all subfields,
                  many modern-day elements of macroecology are implicit in
                  earlier works dating back decades, even centuries.Foundations
                  of Macroecology charts the evolutionary trajectory of these
                  concepts---from the species-area relationship and the
                  latitudinal gradient of species richness to the relationship
                  between body size and metabolic rate---through forty-six
                  landmark papers originally published between 1920 and 1998.
                  Divided into two parts---``Macroecology before Macroecology''
                  and ``Dimensions of Macroecology''---the collection also
                  takes the long view, with each paper accompanied by an
                  original commentary from a contemporary expert in the field
                  that places it in a broader context and explains its
                  foundational role. Providing a solid, coherent assessment of
                  the history, current state, and potential future of the
                  field, Foundations of Macroecology will be an essential text
                  for students and teachers of ecology alike.",

  abstract    = "The difficulty of experimentally quantifying non-trophic
                 species interactions has long troubled ecologists.
                 Increasingly, a new application of the classic ``checkerboard
                 distribution'' approach is used to infer interactions by
                 examining the pairwise frequency at which species are found to
                 spatially co-occur. However, the link between spatial
                 associations, as estimated from observational co-occurrence,
                 and species interactions has not been tested. Here we used
                 nine common statistical methods to estimate associations from
                 surveys of rocky intertidal communities in the Northeast
                 Pacific Ocean. We compared those inferred associations with a
                 new data set of experimentally determined net and direct
                 species interactions. Although association methods generated
                 networks with aggregate structure similar to previously
                 published interaction networks, each method detected a
                 different set of species associations from the same data set.
                 Moreover, although association methods generally performed
                 better than a random model, associations rarely matched
                 empirical net or direct species interactions, with high rates
                 of false positives and true positives, and many false
                 negatives. Our findings cast doubt on studies that equate
                 species co-occurrences to species interactions and highlight a
                 persistent, unanswered question: how do we interpret spatial
                 patterns in communities? We suggest future research directions
                 to unify the observational and experimental study of species
                 interactions, and discuss the need for community standards and
                 best practices in association analysis.",

  abstract    = "Co-occurrence methods are increasingly utilized in ecology to
                 infer networks of species interactions where detailed
                 knowledge based on empirical studies is difficult to obtain.
                 Their use is particularly common, but not restricted to,
                 microbial networks constructed from metagenomic analyses. In
                 this study, we test the efficacy of this procedure by
                 comparing an inferred network constructed using spatially
                 intensive co-occurrence data from the rocky intertidal zone in
                 central Chile to a well-resolved, empirically based, species
                 interaction network from the same region. We evaluated the
                 overlap in the information provided by each network and the
                 extent to which there is a bias for co-occurrence data to
                 better detect known trophic or non-trophic, positive or
                 negative interactions. We found a poor correspondence between
                 the co-occurrence network and the known species interactions
                 with overall sensitivity (probability of true link detection)
                 equal to 0.469, and specificity (true non-interaction) equal
                 to 0.527. The ability to detect interactions varied with
                 interaction type. Positive non-trophic interactions such as
                 commensalism and facilitation were detected at the highest
                 rates. These results demonstrate that co-occurrence networks
                 do not represent classical ecological networks in which
                 interactions are defined by direct observations or
                 experimental manipulations. Co-occurrence networks provide
                 information about the joint spatial effects of environmental
                 conditions, recruitment, and, to some extent, biotic
                 interactions, and among the latter, they tend to better detect
                 niche-expanding positive non-trophic interactions. Detection
                 of links (sensitivity or specificity) was not higher for
                 well-known intertidal keystone species than for the rest of
                 consumers in the community. Thus, as observed in previous
                 empirical and theoretical studies, patterns of interactions in
                 co-occurrence networks must be interpreted with caution,
                 especially when extending interaction-based ecological theory
                 to interpret network variability and stability. Co-occurrence
                 networks may be particularly valuable for analysis of
                 community dynamics that blends interactions and environment,
                 rather than pairwise interactions alone.",
