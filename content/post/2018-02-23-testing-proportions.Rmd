```{r}
args(binom.test)

ns <- seq(2, 200, by = 2)
xs <- ns / 2

binom.test(xs[3], ns[3])

test_to_200 <- purrr::map2(xs, ns, binom.test)


library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
purrr::map_df(test_to_200, broom::tidy) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = parameter, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + geom_ribbon()
  
```

there is also [this very classic paper](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article/26/4/404/291538)

and this more recent thing: [proportions done seven ways](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=BF0333B82FD5B5A73FD66C40CA464E37?doi=10.1.1.326.1772)
