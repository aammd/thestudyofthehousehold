                   posterior distribu- tion, and Bayesian visualization is
                   about more than trace plots of Markov chains. Practical
                   Bayesian data analysis, like all data analysis, is an
                   iterative process of model building, inference, model
                   checking and evaluation, and model expansion. Visualization
                   is helpful in each of these stages of the Bayesian workflow
                   and it is indispensable when drawing inferences from the
                   types of modern, high-dimensional models that are used by
                   applied researchers.",

  abstract      = "The brms package allows R users to easily specify a wide
                   range of Bayesian multilevel models, which are fitted with
                   the probabilistic programming language Stan behind the
                   scenes. A wide range of response distributions are supported
                   in combination with an intuitive and powerful multilevel
                   formula syntax. Non-linear relationships may be specified
                   using non-linear predictor terms, splines or Gaussian
                   processes. Additionally, all parameters of the response
                   distribution can be predicted at the same time allowing for
                   distributional regression. Model fit can be investigated and
                   compared using leave-one-out cross-validation and graphical
                   posterior-predictive checks. Many more post-processing and
                   plotting methods are implemented.",
